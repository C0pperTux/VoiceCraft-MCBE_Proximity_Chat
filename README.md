## Project Description
VoiceCraft proximity chat is a VOIP program developed on .NET 7.0 WPF framework developed in C# started by SineVector241 that enables Voice Proximity chat for the game Minecraft on the bedrock platform which gives a more immersive, communicative experience. This project will also expand into supporting more platforms such as IOS and Android devices using Xamarin. The project only allows for a self-hosted framework giving the owners more control on how they want it to be setup however the project may also expand into allowing multiple server instances on a single server that does not require a self-hosted framework and allows other users to host for other Minecraft server owners.
